# herdr-annotate
Annotate inside [Herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr): comment on any terminal text, review whole Markdown documents and your agent's replies, and send the feedback straight back to the agent. Document review is powered by [plannotator-tui](https://github.com/plannotator/plannotator-tui), which also runs on its own outside Herdr.

## Requirements

- Herdr 0.8.0 or later
- macOS, Linux, or Windows

There is no runtime to install. Both installs download a small prebuilt `herdr-annotate` binary and verify its SHA-256 checksum.

On Linux, install `wl-clipboard`, `xclip`, or `xsel` for clipboard access.

On Windows, native Herdr plugin support is preview/best-effort. Clipboard access uses PowerShell; no extra clipboard package is required. The install, keybinding, configuration check, reload, and use instructions below also apply on Windows.

## Install

Pick one. Installing the other later just swaps it (same plugin id). An install stays on the commit it came from; run the same command again to move to the current release.

**Full:** annotate terminal text, review documents and agent replies, send feedback to the agent.
Wraps [Plannotator TUI](https://github.com/plannotator/plannotator-tui) (macOS and Linux today). [Demo](https://x.com/plannotator/status/2093419561077154287)

```sh
herdr plugin install plannotator/herdr-annotate
```

**Lite:** the simple version: select text, `prefix+a`, comment in a popover. [Demo](https://x.com/plannotator/status/2092757422322627008)

```sh
herdr plugin install plannotator/herdr-annotate/lite

## Use

### Annotate terminal text

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+B A` | comment on the selected text · `Ctrl+S` saves |
| `Ctrl+B Shift+A` | copy all annotations as Markdown |
| `Ctrl+B Ctrl+A` | copy all annotations as Markdown, then archive them |
| `Ctrl+B M` | manage · `y` copy one · `c` copy all · `Shift+C` copy and archive · `Tab` archives (`y` copy · `u` restore · `d d` delete) |

Copies made inside the manager pane also emit OSC 52, so on Herdr 0.9.0 they reach the clipboard of
the machine you are viewing from even when the plugin runs on a remote server with no clipboard tool
installed; `Ctrl+B Shift+A` and `Ctrl+B Ctrl+A` do not, because those actions run outside a pane and
have no terminal to write to.

### Review documents and agent replies

Full install. Works with Claude Code, Codex, pi, Copilot CLI, Droid, Oh My Pi, Hermes CLI and OpenCode (1 and 2).

| Key | Opens |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+B O` | this folder, with a file tree |
| `Ctrl+B Shift+O` | the agent's recent replies |
| Ctrl-click a `file://…md` link | that file |

**Send** (or `E`) makes the review the agent's next message. `q` closes.

| Option | Where |
|---|---|
| Agents request reviews themselves | `npx skills add plannotator/herdr-annotate --skill plannotator-tui -g` |
| Open as full tab, split, or popup | `[herdr] placement = "overlay" \| "split" \| "popup"` in `~/.config/plannotator-tui/config.toml` |
| Use without Herdr | [plannotator-tui](https://github.com/plannotator/plannotator-tui) |

### Remote sessions

Over SSH or `herdr --remote`, the plugin runs on the **server**, and two things get in the way:
Herdr's default copy-on-select clears the selection on mouse-up, and the prefix keypress
clears whatever selection remains before a bound action runs
([herdrdev/herdr#3380](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr/issues/3380)). A headless server also
has no clipboard for the plugin to fall back to.

What works today:

1. On the server, keep the selection after mouse-up:

   ```toml
   # remote server: ~/.config/herdr/config.toml
   [ui]
   copy_on_select = false   # the selection stays; copy explicitly with Ctrl+C
   ```

2. Trigger the action **without a keypress in Herdr**, while the selection is still
   highlighted. From your laptop, bound to any key in your terminal or OS:

   ```sh
   ssh <host> herdr plugin action invoke annotate.capture
   # named session on the server: ssh <host> HERDR_SESSION=<name> herdr plugin action invoke annotate.capture
   ```

   The action reads the focused pane's selection through Herdr's API, which never touches the
   keyboard path, so the text arrives. Verified: the same selection gives `selected_text` this
   way and nothing through `prefix+a`.

3. In Neovim, use the mapping below; it hands the selection over in a file.

Server-side key bindings and `herdr --remote <host> --remote-keybindings server` are still
needed for the manager (`prefix+m`) and other plugin keys; without the flag, `herdr --remote`
uses your local keys and drops plugin bindings. `prefix+a` itself will work once
herdrdev/herdr#3380 is fixed.

## Selection limits

Herdr Annotate reads text that Herdr copies to the system clipboard. The plugin cannot read selection state from Neovim or another terminal application.

## Development

The plugin is a Rust binary in `rust/`.

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
bash scripts/stage-local.sh    # build and stage bin/herdr-annotate.exe
herdr plugin link "$PWD"       # or "$PWD/lite" for the Lite variant
```

`herdr plugin link` does not run manifest build hooks, so stage the binary first. It also replaces
any existing `annotate` link; link the other directory to switch back.

`bash scripts/lite-regression.sh` checks the runtime against goldens recorded from the retired Bun
runtime. [docs/lite-testing.md](docs/lite-testing.md) covers what it compares and everything else
that guards Lite.

To test a local plannotator-tui build instead of the pinned release, put it in `bin/`
before linking: `PLANNOTATOR_TUI_BIN=/path/to/plannotator-tui bash scripts/fetch-plannotator-tui.sh`.

Before a release, `HERDR_SESSION=<disposable session> bash scripts/smoke.sh` installs fresh, upgrades
from the first shipped commit, installs lite, swaps to full, and opens the manager and review panes,
then restores whatever was installed.

## Neovim integration

Add this visual-mode mapping to `~/.config/nvim/lua/config/keymaps.lua` for LazyVim, or to `init.lua`:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("x", "<leader>a", function()
  -- Hand the selection to the plugin through a file: works on headless servers too.
  vim.cmd('normal! "zy')
  local base = os.getenv("XDG_RUNTIME_DIR")
  if not base or base == "" then base = vim.fn.fnamemodify(vim.fn.tempname(), ":h") end
  local dir = base .. "/herdr-annotate-" .. vim.loop.getuid()
  vim.fn.mkdir(dir, "p", "0700")
  vim.fn.writefile(vim.split(vim.fn.getreg("z"), "\n"), dir .. "/selection")
  vim.fn.jobstart({ "herdr", "plugin", "action", "invoke", "annotate.capture" })
end, { desc = "Annotate in Herdr" })
```

Select text with the mouse or Visual mode. Then press `<leader>a` to open Herdr Annotate.
The file is read once and removed; a file older than 15 seconds is ignored.

LazyVim uses `Space` as `<leader>` by default. The mapping keeps mouse support and leaves normal Neovim commands unchanged.
